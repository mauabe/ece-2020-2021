    textCopy: '<p  style="text-indent:0;"><span class="first-letter"> The</span> 2019-2020 school year began like any other year but ended with a pandemic that has not been seen for a hundred years and is still raging as I pen this message. As we weather this most “interesting (of) times”, we look back on our past year. While much has been changing, much remains the same. As is shown in this annual report, the excellence of our department in our research and teaching has continued. </p> <p> Numerous recognitions bestowed upon our faculty and students are described in this report which reflects the quality of research and teaching of the department. A few in particular bears highlighting. Professor <span>Warren Mori</span> won the James Clerk Maxwell Prize, the highest honor in plasma physics. This prize is especially meaningful within our department since Professors Chan Joshi and Francis Chen of our department were both prior awardees. This year, our alumni, <span>Dr. Reza Rofougaran</span> is elected a Fellow of National Academy of Engineering, the highest honor in the nation for engineers, and  <span>  Professor Chee Wei Wong </span> joins the esteemed ranks of the National Academy of Inventors as a Fellow. Within their respective fields, several of our faculty,  <span>Professor William Kaiser </span> and <span> Professor Paulo Tabuada</span>, have garnered recognition for their contributions as Fellows of AIMBE and IFAC respectively. New research from our junior faculty ranks has also gained much attention. <span> Professor Xiang Chen </span> is selected a Hellman Fellow for his advancements on intelligent user interfaces for IoT devices and medical applications. </span> Professor Sam Emaminejad</span>, a recent recipient of the NSF Career Award, is highlighted on national news for his wearable devices that detect biomarkers to enable personalized medicine. Our students have garnered recognition as well. Two students of <span>Professors Sudhakar Pamarti</span> and </span>Danijela Cabric</span> have been awarded the Qualcomm Innovations Fellowship for their use of time-varying sampling and data conversion for wireless signal detection. Finally, very recently, <span>emeritus Professor Oscar Stafsudd </span> is working with the UCLA Medical Center in developing a test for COVID-19 that can potentially yield results in minutes. These are but a few of the exciting achievements. </p> <p>  This year we celebrate the arrival of a new faculty member, <span> Professor Nader Sehatbaksh</span>. One of his research profiles side-channel information from processors such as radiated signals to show its potential as a means to breach the security of the computation. By analyzing the information, he proposes means to mitigate the intrusion by dynamically altering the computation. This research area of privacy-preserving computation is a key challenge to modern cloud computing environments. </p> <p> My role as the department chairman began this past summer following the excellent leadership of <span> Professor Greg Pottie</span>. The responsibility came during the time of a perfect storm of global health concerns, budgetary constraints, and social unrest. These challenges are not mere bumps in the road but likely to persist requiring long-term solutions. At the same time, I also anticipate the continuation of our tradition of cutting-edge research coupled with innovative teaching. The remote learning imposed by the pandemic has inspired new teaching methods which will have lasting impact on how we engage our students. We have developed new instructional laboratories with individualized equipment that enable each student to explore hands-on learning at their own pace. We have initiated new research directions delving more deeply into quantum computing, digital health and medical devices, novel applications of machine learning, and next generation communication. Together with the school-wide initiatives, we are proactively improving the inclusiveness of our undergraduate, graduate, and faculty bodies. </p> <p> In these challenging times, our connection with our alumni and industry has only become more important. Our new Vice-Chair of Industry Affiliates, <span>Professor Subramanian Iyer</span>, is actively establishing stronger connections with our partners to help our graduating students transition to vibrant careers. Both our <span>Alumni Advisory Board</span>, chaired by <span>Professor Asad Madni</span>, and our <span>Alumnae Advisory Committee</span>, chaired by <span>Professor Abeer Alwan</span>, are actively involving our alumni in guiding the direction of our department and mentoring our students. </p> <p>  As hopes of a vaccine materialize, testing becomes readily available on-campus, and as UCLA rolls out our contact tracing app, we look forward to return to campus for in-person educational and social interactions. While the pandemic is taking its devastating toll, there is light at the end of the tunnel. We march onward to address our challenges and to carry-on our educational mission.   </p><p> '

    textCopy: '<p  style="text-indent:0;"><span class="first-letter"> Plumerias </span> are beautiful, colorful flowering plants that produce numerous flowers with fragrant scents. These flowers are famously recognized in Hawaiian leis and are easy to grow in our Southern California climate. It’s impossible to track all the different flowers and scents because there are countless varieties, however the pink, yellow and white varieties seem to be the easiest to grow. Reds and bi-colors sometimes need a little more care. Here are some simple tips you can use to keep your Plumeria plants healthy and blooming.</p><p> In coastal regions, Plumerias can be placed in the direct sun without harm. For inland areas, plants should be placed in a partially protection location. A little shade will protect foliage and stems from becoming scorched and will also prevent sun scalding on the stems.</p><p> Plumerias can survive with little moisture. You can even forget to water them and the plant will survive. Overwatering is the most common mistake gardeners make when it comes to Plumerias. They can hold an excess amount of moisture in their stems and branches, which make this remarkable plant very durable in gardens or containers in hot areas.</p><p> Plant Plumerias in a well-drained soil. Cactus mix is easy and effective as a soil medium. Plumerias planted in heavy soils are susceptible to root rot. This type of heavy soil should be amended with peat moss and perlite to add oxygenation and acidity.</p><p> During the cooler seasons Plumerias will start to defoliate. This is natural; keep them in a protected place away from freezing temperatures and keep watering to a minimum. Dry soil is okay; water once a month or even less during the cooler months.</p><p> Fertilizing is a simple process. Use an all-purpose organic fertilizer and apply it in late February before the plant awakens from dormancy and pushes new foliage.</p><p> In order for Plumeria flowers to bloom, their soil should be around a ph level of 5.5 to 6.0. You can use an acidic fertilizer called Nourish Bio Sol to acidify the soil and produce the best flowering results.  </p>'

    textCopy: '<p style="text-indent:0;"><span class="first-letter"> My </span> research interests cover a wide range, mainly in the intersections of control theory, geometry, network sciences, machine learning, and game theory. For the purpose of this brief note, I focus on one recent topic that has occupied some of my time.</p><p>The abundance of access to data and advanced sensing apparatus has made the interplay between "uncertainty", "stability", and "performance" at the cusp of focus for achieving certifiable autonomy. Providing such certificates is in the roots of control theory, with the foundations of robustness and adaptation going back decades. Adaptive control, for instance, was built precisely to deal with unknown parameters while providing some stability certificates. Much of the classical development of the subject, however, was focused on systems with models at hand. The key challenge in nowadays complex problems such as autonomous driving is lack of such models, along with the fact that the decisions are made in an online fashion. The latter is in sharp contrast with offline problems in machine learning, such as algorithms behind Alpha Go, where training algorithms provide incomparable results. On the other hand, model-free techniques, such as reinforcement learning, often do not come with stability guarantees. The expected standards for future autonomous vehicles are in a way that robustness and stability guarantees are indispensable.</p><p>As control theorists, we are often concerned with stability; we do not want systems to go unstable, ever. In this sense, we are trained to be conservative. Learning about unknowns, by its nature, requires exploration, and enforcing stability prevents exploratory decisions. If the objective is for an autonomous vehicle to follow a certain path, with the abundance of unknowns present, implementing classical control strategies with robustness certificates would simply bring the car to halt. In this sense, if the measure of performance is how well the path is followed, the performance will be very poor. On the contrary, core techniques in machine learning, ranging from online optimization to reinforcement learning, are often solely concerned with performance. Even though it is a gross generalization, the interplay I depicted is present across the board. The key question that I am interested in is on how to mathematically capture this interplay, and how to generate certificates that meet the standards of future autonomous systems.</p>'

    textCopy: '  <p style="text-indent:0;"><span class="first-letter"> Our </span> environments are getting smarter. Advances in sensors, actuators, and communication have made the vision of ambient intelligence increasingly achievable. We have seen an increasing number of smarts around us such as voice assistants, service robots, UAVs, autonomous vehicles, and a broader array of connective objects in IoT. Professor Yang Zhang creates enabling technologies to make ambient intelligence more powerful in facilitating the future of work, healthcare, and education. He also researches human-centered design frameworks to make ambient intelligence and the environments they reside in equally accessible to all and can be developed by anyone. Professor Zhang is currently directing the Human-Centered Computing & Intelligent Sensing Lab (HiLab) at UCLA ECE. <span>https://www.hilab.dev</span></p><h3>Pillar 1: Create more powerful ambient intelligence</h3><p>HiLab creates sensing technologies to extend the capabilities of ambient intelligence. Such technologies improve the communication bandwidth between ambient intelligence by prepping everyday objects for interactivity -- intelligent walls that sense human poses, cameras that turn surfaces into high-precision touchscreens. Additionally, HiLab develops novel sensors that monitor events and user activities for environmental and personal informatics, such as cameras that sense vibrations to recognize building- and city-scale activities. Overall, this research pillar enables ambient intelligence to acquire knowledge from people either explicitly (i.e., interaction) or implicitly (i.e., event and activity recognition) in a practical manner.</p><h3>Pillar 2: Use ambient intelligence to make the physical world accessible to all</h3><p>Ambient intelligence also opens new opportunities for making the physical world equally accessible to all. Specifically, HiLab develops systems that can digitize the physical world for accessibility applications, including virtual and augmented reality techniques that allow people with disabilities to better navigate through a world full of barriers and inaccessible information. HiLab also creates intelligent sensing and actuation systems that can be easily deployed by people with motor impairments (e.g., users of wheelchairs) for independent living and improved life qualities.</p><h3>Pillar 3: Lower the barrier for everyone to create ambient intelligence</h3><p>Finally, HiLab aims to empower everyone to create ambient intelligence. By improving their environments, people improve their lives (e.g., switching for a brighter lightbulb). We believe that people should be able to create ambient intelligence as easily as switching a lightbulb. Besides sponsoring the community with toolkits of existing research, HiLab also seeks general design frameworks that can be easily adopted by anyone for any application. Ongoing research in this pillar includes 1) creating open-source sensor toolkits, 2) developing frameworks for developers to create human-centered energy-constrained systems, and 3) using augmented and virtual reality to facilitate developing and debugging of smart environments. </p>'

    textCopy: '  <p style="text-indent:0;"><span class="first-letter"> As a Child, </span>  Kat Echazarreta ’19 was fascinated by electricity. How does electricity work? And why? How can electricity be used to create new technologies? Now, this UCLA electrical engineering alumna is working at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). She knows the answers to all those questions, and more.</p><p> Inside her world at JPL, Echazarreta is an electrical engineer with the Ground Support Equipment team where she designs, builds and tests equipment vital to the Europa Clipper mission. NASA’s goal is to launch the spacecraft into orbit around Jupiter’s moon Europa in 2024 to determine whether Europa can harbor conditions suitable for life.</p><p>  Before landing her dream job at JPL, Echazarreta notes in her blog that her educational journey was not a straight shot.</p><p>  Born in Mexico, Echazarreta moved with her family to the U.S. at the age of seven after her father received a work visa. She faced a language barrier at first, making it difficult to adjust to her new home. But within two years, she became a fluent English speaker.</p><p> Katya Echazarreta“It was definitely an obstacle for me to learn about a brand new culture and to learn a brand new language,” Echazarreta said. “I recall being made fun of for my accent, but I was determined to push through. It helped me become really hard working from a young age, and to not be afraid of a challenge.”</p><p>  Echazarreta, a first-generation college student, credits her mom for instilling in her a strong work ethic and encouraging her to follow her passions in space, astronomy and math. After high school, she enrolled in the San Diego City College studying electrical engineering for three years before transferring to UCLA.</p><p>“When I first visited UCLA, I felt like I had found my second home,” Echazarreta said. “I had found the place that would help me become the engineer I wanted to become.”</p><p> As a transfer student, Echazarreta said it was difficult at first to keep up with the fast-paced curriculum. Navigating the quarter system wasn’t easy, especially because it seemed as though her classmates already knew one another. She overcame these challenges by readjusting her priorities.</p><p> “I realized that in order to succeed I needed to take care of myself,” Echazarreta said. “I had to learn how to prioritize myself in order to be fully present during class and study sessions.”</p><p>  While at UCLA, Echazarreta was involved in robotics research, which provided hands-on experience with developing testing procedures that helped her secure her first internship at JPL.</p><p>  Echazarreta was also active in the Center for Excellence in Engineering and Diversity (CEED) and the Society of Latino Engineers and Scientists (SOLES), both of which supported her academic endeavors and had a positive impact on her career.v</p><p>   Outside of her work at JPL, Echazarreta uses her social media to embolden and motivate others.</p><p> Echazarreta acts as a “big sister” for other young women interested in STEM, she said, creating and sharing content she wishes she had seen when she was in school and searching for internships and jobs.</p><p>   “I hope that through my work with social media, other young women, girls and aspiring engineers will see that there is a place for them within these large organizations,” Echazarreta said.</p><p> With more than 26,000 followers on Instagram, Echazarreta regularly posts photos from her job and videos on what it’s like to be a woman in engineering. She also shares resources and inspiring stories about her personal journey to becoming an engineer.</p><p> “I hope that through my work with social media, other young women, girls and aspiring engineers will see that there is a place for them within these large organizations,” Echazarreta said. “It’s important for me to share my story with others who feel like giving up.”</p><p> For students interested in following a similar career path, Echazarreta suggests attending career fairs and conferences, and networking as much as possible. Mentors from internships can also help students find jobs after graduation.</p><p>“[Finding a job] takes persistence,” Echazarreta said. “It was five months before I heard back from JPL for my first position with them.”</p><p>   Looking ahead, Echazarreta is starting a part-time Master’s program in electrical engineering this upcoming fall at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, while continuing to work full-time at JPL. “I’m excited to keep learning, earn larger technical leadership roles and continue to inspire others along the way,” she said.  </p>'
