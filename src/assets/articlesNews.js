    textCopy: '<p style="text-indent:0;"><span class="first-letter"> Whether a horse </span> is momentarily airborne, with all its feet off the floor at once, was a question that had plagued eccentric photographer Eadweard Muybridge until in 1872, he was asked by Leland Stanford, then governor of California, to take up the challenge of photographing his horse while galloping to see whether artists had been right in their depiction of the flying horse. For the photography of the time, Muybridge succeeded at this challenging task by triggering 12 different cameras as the horses ran past to create a sequential series of photographs of the motion.</p><p>Many of today’s basic questions in physics and engineering are studied using this same photographic concept, albeit at far smaller and faster scales approaching fundamental atomic scales. That is, if we see something happening that occurs in 100 milliseconds (a tenth of a second), we generally perceive the event as occurring instantaneously. But for quantum systems, such as atoms, molecules, and condensed matter systems, this may even be longer than their entire lifetime. Many of the changes atomic and molecular systems undergo occur on femtosecond (quadrillionth of a second) or faster timescales. This is such a short timescale that one femtosecond is to one second as one second is to about 32 million years.</p><p>Through our research in the Quantum Light-Matter Cooperative (Q-LMC), we can develop unique instrumentation and capture changes in quantum systems relevant for myriad applications – from medicine to quantum technologies –far too fast and too small for standards cameras to resolve. By using the ultrashort and very bright pulses of uniquely engineering light, our research provides a means to watch exactly how molecules react when they interact with light or undergo changes, such as photo-chemical reactions, protein dynamics, or quantum electrodynamics, among many others.</p><h3> Engineering light as scientific instrumentation</h3><p></p>One way of accessing unprecedentedly bright pulses of light is using X-ray free electron lasers (XFEL), which are usually miles-long facilities that accelerate electrons to the speed of light and then wiggle them with magnets. As part of our research portfolio, the Q-LMC develops new light-electron techniques to manipulate the electron beams that are used not only in XFEL experiments but also for another type of experiment, ultrafast electron diffraction (UED). In the latter, rather than shining X-rays on a molecule to film its motion, UED uses electrons instead. By detecting how the path of the electrons has changed as a result of interacting with the molecule, a picture can be constructed of how the molecule looked at a particular moment in time. As well as making XFELs better, the Q-LMC investigates ways to make them smaller and democratize access to these incredible machines. The length of the accelerators is necessary to provide sufficiently strong field gradients to accelerate the electrons up to speed, ideally in an orderly fashion. We study laser-driven accelerators may offer a more compact alternative to traditional radio frequency technology-based designs for applications in targeted radiation therapy and future quantum information technologies. The strong field gradients produced within a laser pulse make it possible to achieve comparable acceleration in a matter of millimeters, rather than miles.</p><h3>Applications of engineering light</h3><p>These incredibly powerful light sources make tracking physical chemistry in the femtosecond and even attosecond scale possible. To date, there have been countless discoveries made possible by engineered light technologies, such as tracking and identifying the intermediate chemical structures involved in water oxidation, an important part of photosynthesis, and seeing the structures and shapes of proteins at an unparalleled level of detail. Working on more challenging chemical systems which only produce weak signals or are very dilute will also be made possible with developments in the technology.</p>Higher peak brightness also opens the possibility of exploring new regimes of physics, such as non-linear processes and exotic strong-field effects. Being able to explore the possibilities of experiments with structured light and in these extreme conditions is crucial for developing our understanding of how light interacts with matter. Given the strong interest in using light in many areas of our lives, from cancer treatment with photodynamic therapy, to as a renewable energy source with solar technologies or negative emission technologies to tackle our climate crisis, gaining this fundamental understanding of light-matter interactions is crucial for knowing how to exploit it in the development of new and more efficient technologies.</p><p>Over the last decade, Sergio Carbajo\'s research has been dedicated to the pursuit of transformational photon and particle sources and their applications in basic and environmental sciences, medicine, and industry. Photon and particle sources are powerful tools with extremely high societal impact because they underpin myriad ground-breaking scientific, technological, and medical advancements. He carried out a joint doctoral program simultaneously at the Research Laboratory of Electronics, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and the Center for Free Electron Laser Science, Deutsches Elektronen Synchrotron, and obtained his Ph.D. in Physics in 2015. In addition to being an assistant professor at the UCLA ECE department, Sergio is affiliated with the Linac Coherent Light Source at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center and the UCLA Physics department. He has received several awards recognizing his contributions to the development of novel ultrafast photon and particle sources, and their application in ultrafast phenomena for life and energy sciences, including the 2021 Horizon Prize from the Royal Society of Chemistry, the 2021 SPIE Early Career Achievement Award, the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science Fellowship in 2019, the SRI 2018 Young Scientist Award, and the PIER Helmholtz Foundation Dissertation Award in 2015, among others. He is actively engaged in professional service and outreach activities devoted to underrepresented minorities and to promote equity in educational and professional opportunities. <span><i>https://light-matter.seas.ucla.edu</i></span></p>'

    textCopy: '<p style="text-indent:0;"><span class="first-letter"> My </span> research interests cover a wide range, mainly in the intersections of control theory, geometry, network sciences, machine learning, and game theory. For the purpose of this brief note, I focus on one recent topic that has occupied some of my time.</p><p>The abundance of access to data and advanced sensing apparatus has made the interplay between "uncertainty", "stability", and "performance" at the cusp of focus for achieving certifiable autonomy. Providing such certificates is in the roots of control theory, with the foundations of robustness and adaptation going back decades. Adaptive control, for instance, was built precisely to deal with unknown parameters while providing some stability certificates. Much of the classical development of the subject, however, was focused on systems with models at hand. The key challenge in nowadays complex problems such as autonomous driving is lack of such models, along with the fact that the decisions are made in an online fashion. The latter is in sharp contrast with offline problems in machine learning, such as algorithms behind Alpha Go, where training algorithms provide incomparable results. On the other hand, model-free techniques, such as reinforcement learning, often do not come with stability guarantees. The expected standards for future autonomous vehicles are in a way that robustness and stability guarantees are indispensable.</p><p>As control theorists, we are often concerned with stability; we do not want systems to go unstable, ever. In this sense, we are trained to be conservative. Learning about unknowns, by its nature, requires exploration, and enforcing stability prevents exploratory decisions. If the objective is for an autonomous vehicle to follow a certain path, with the abundance of unknowns present, implementing classical control strategies with robustness certificates would simply bring the car to halt. In this sense, if the measure of performance is how well the path is followed, the performance will be very poor. On the contrary, core techniques in machine learning, ranging from online optimization to reinforcement learning, are often solely concerned with performance. Even though it is a gross generalization, the interplay I depicted is present across the board. The key question that I am interested in is on how to mathematically capture this interplay, and how to generate certificates that meet the standards of future autonomous systems.</p>'

    textCopy: '  <p style="text-indent:0;"><span class="first-letter"> Our </span> environments are getting smarter. Advances in sensors, actuators, and communication have made the vision of ambient intelligence increasingly achievable. We have seen an increasing number of smarts around us such as voice assistants, service robots, UAVs, autonomous vehicles, and a broader array of connective objects in IoT. Professor Yang Zhang creates enabling technologies to make ambient intelligence more powerful in facilitating the future of work, healthcare, and education. He also researches human-centered design frameworks to make ambient intelligence and the environments they reside in equally accessible to all and can be developed by anyone. Professor Zhang is currently directing the Human-Centered Computing & Intelligent Sensing Lab (HiLab) at UCLA ECE. <span>https://www.hilab.dev</span></p><h3>Pillar 1: Create more powerful ambient intelligence</h3><p>HiLab creates sensing technologies to extend the capabilities of ambient intelligence. Such technologies improve the communication bandwidth between ambient intelligence by prepping everyday objects for interactivity -- intelligent walls that sense human poses, cameras that turn surfaces into high-precision touchscreens. Additionally, HiLab develops novel sensors that monitor events and user activities for environmental and personal informatics, such as cameras that sense vibrations to recognize building- and city-scale activities. Overall, this research pillar enables ambient intelligence to acquire knowledge from people either explicitly (i.e., interaction) or implicitly (i.e., event and activity recognition) in a practical manner.</p><h3>Pillar 2: Use ambient intelligence to make the physical world accessible to all</h3><p>Ambient intelligence also opens new opportunities for making the physical world equally accessible to all. Specifically, HiLab develops systems that can digitize the physical world for accessibility applications, including virtual and augmented reality techniques that allow people with disabilities to better navigate through a world full of barriers and inaccessible information. HiLab also creates intelligent sensing and actuation systems that can be easily deployed by people with motor impairments (e.g., users of wheelchairs) for independent living and improved life qualities.</p><h3>Pillar 3: Lower the barrier for everyone to create ambient intelligence</h3><p>Finally, HiLab aims to empower everyone to create ambient intelligence. By improving their environments, people improve their lives (e.g., switching for a brighter lightbulb). We believe that people should be able to create ambient intelligence as easily as switching a lightbulb. Besides sponsoring the community with toolkits of existing research, HiLab also seeks general design frameworks that can be easily adopted by anyone for any application. Ongoing research in this pillar includes 1) creating open-source sensor toolkits, 2) developing frameworks for developers to create human-centered energy-constrained systems, and 3) using augmented and virtual reality to facilitate developing and debugging of smart environments. </p>'
