    textCopy: '<p  style="text-indent:0;"><span class="first-letter"> The</span> 2019-2020 school year began like any other year but ended with a pandemic that has not been seen for a hundred years and is still raging as I pen this message. As we weather this most “interesting (of) times”, we look back on our past year. While much has been changing, much remains the same. As is shown in this annual report, the excellence of our department in our research and teaching has continued. </p> <p> Numerous recognitions bestowed upon our faculty and students are described in this report which reflects the quality of research and teaching of the department. A few in particular bears highlighting. Professor <span>Warren Mori</span> won the James Clerk Maxwell Prize, the highest honor in plasma physics. This prize is especially meaningful within our department since Professors Chan Joshi and Francis Chen of our department were both prior awardees. This year, our alumni, <span>Dr. Reza Rofougaran</span> is elected a Fellow of National Academy of Engineering, the highest honor in the nation for engineers, and  <span>  Professor Chee Wei Wong </span> joins the esteemed ranks of the National Academy of Inventors as a Fellow. Within their respective fields, several of our faculty,  <span>Professor William Kaiser </span> and <span> Professor Paulo Tabuada</span>, have garnered recognition for their contributions as Fellows of AIMBE and IFAC respectively. New research from our junior faculty ranks has also gained much attention. <span> Professor Xiang Chen </span> is selected a Hellman Fellow for his advancements on intelligent user interfaces for IoT devices and medical applications. </span> Professor Sam Emaminejad</span>, a recent recipient of the NSF Career Award, is highlighted on national news for his wearable devices that detect biomarkers to enable personalized medicine. Our students have garnered recognition as well. Two students of <span>Professors Sudhakar Pamarti</span> and </span>Danijela Cabric</span> have been awarded the Qualcomm Innovations Fellowship for their use of time-varying sampling and data conversion for wireless signal detection. Finally, very recently, <span>emeritus Professor Oscar Stafsudd </span> is working with the UCLA Medical Center in developing a test for COVID-19 that can potentially yield results in minutes. These are but a few of the exciting achievements. </p> <p>  This year we celebrate the arrival of a new faculty member, <span> Professor Nader Sehatbaksh</span>. One of his research profiles side-channel information from processors such as radiated signals to show its potential as a means to breach the security of the computation. By analyzing the information, he proposes means to mitigate the intrusion by dynamically altering the computation. This research area of privacy-preserving computation is a key challenge to modern cloud computing environments. </p> <p> My role as the department chairman began this past summer following the excellent leadership of <span> Professor Greg Pottie</span>. The responsibility came during the time of a perfect storm of global health concerns, budgetary constraints, and social unrest. These challenges are not mere bumps in the road but likely to persist requiring long-term solutions. At the same time, I also anticipate the continuation of our tradition of cutting-edge research coupled with innovative teaching. The remote learning imposed by the pandemic has inspired new teaching methods which will have lasting impact on how we engage our students. We have developed new instructional laboratories with individualized equipment that enable each student to explore hands-on learning at their own pace. We have initiated new research directions delving more deeply into quantum computing, digital health and medical devices, novel applications of machine learning, and next generation communication. Together with the school-wide initiatives, we are proactively improving the inclusiveness of our undergraduate, graduate, and faculty bodies. </p> <p> In these challenging times, our connection with our alumni and industry has only become more important. Our new Vice-Chair of Industry Affiliates, <span>Professor Subramanian Iyer</span>, is actively establishing stronger connections with our partners to help our graduating students transition to vibrant careers. Both our <span>Alumni Advisory Board</span>, chaired by <span>Professor Asad Madni</span>, and our <span>Alumnae Advisory Committee</span>, chaired by <span>Professor Abeer Alwan</span>, are actively involving our alumni in guiding the direction of our department and mentoring our students. </p> <p>  As hopes of a vaccine materialize, testing becomes readily available on-campus, and as UCLA rolls out our contact tracing app, we look forward to return to campus for in-person educational and social interactions. While the pandemic is taking its devastating toll, there is light at the end of the tunnel. We march onward to address our challenges and to carry-on our educational mission.   </p><p> '

    textCopy: '<p  style="text-indent:0;"><span class="first-letter"> Computers </span> are becoming increasingly pervasive and critical in our lives due to the rise of embedded devices and cyber-physical systems. While these systems are performing their primary task: computing, they create unwanted footprints that can leak potentially sensitive information about the system through unconventional channels called side-channels. With the ever-increasing reliance on computing systems, it is important to deeply understand how these side-channel signals can be created, how side-channel leakage can be mitigated (and even leveraged for useful applications), and how future systems should be designed to be robust against side-channel attacks.</p><p>     As a researcher in the area of computer architecture and hardware security, my research was mainly focused on proposing new methods to a) discover, model, and mitigate side-channel signals on modern systems and b) leverage side-channel signals for useful purposes (e.g., profiling, intrusion detection, establishing trust) to improve the security and/or performance of resource-constrained devices such as embedded and cyber-physical systems. My work on leveraging analog-domain side-channel signals for profiling, having received the prestigious Best Paper Award at MICRO-49, is the first of its kind and has created a new area for research in computer architecture.</p><p>      Moving forward, I will continue to investigate new methods for mitigating side-channels to design secure architectures for future systems and emerging technologies such as cyber-physical systems, domain-specific accelerators, and persistent memories. Moreover, building upon my current work, I am planning to expand my research into emerging topics: Remote Computation, Privacy-Preserving Computing, and Trustworthy AI.</p></br><p>       Bio: Nader Sehatbakhsh is an assistant professor at UCLA. His research interest is on the broad area of Security and Privacy with emphasis on hardware support for security and privacy. Specifically, he is interested in computer architecture, IoT Security, embedded/cyber-physical systems, side-channels, trusted computing and hardware enclaves, and security and privacy in machine learning. His work has been published in top venues such as MICRO, ISCA, and HPCA, and has been recognized with several awards and honors including the MICRO-49 Best Paper Award and Micro Top-Picks Honorable Mention.  </p><p>       He earned a Ph.D. in Computer Science from Georgia Tech\'s  School of Computer Science, where he worked on Securing Computing Systems by Mitigating and Leveraging Side-Channels. He earned his B.Sc. in Electrical Engineering from the University of Tehran in 2013.   </p>  '
