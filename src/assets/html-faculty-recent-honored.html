    <div class="page-text">
        <p>The <span>National Academy of Inventors </span>was founded in 2010 to recognize and encourage inventors with patents issued from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, enhance the visibility of academic technology and innovation, encourage the disclosure of intellectual property, educate and mentor innovative students, and translate the inventions of its members to benefit society. National Academy of Inventors is a US non-profit organization dedicated to encouraging inventors in academia, following the model of the National Academies of the United States. The NAI Senior Member program is an exclusive award distinction reserved for NAI Member Institutions like University of California, Los Angeles. NAI Senior Members are active faculty, scientists and administrators with success in patents, licensing and commercialization and have produced technologies that have brought, or aspire to bring, real impact on the welfare of society. Senior Members also foster a spirit of innovation within their communities through enhancing an inventive atmosphere at their institutions, while educating and mentoring the next generation of inventors.
