    textCopy: '<p  style="text-indent:0;"><span class="first-letter"> Professor </span>   Suhas Diggavi has received several recognitions from Facebook, Amazon and Guggenheim in a stellar academic year.</p><p>    Suhas Diggavi leads the Information Theory and Systems Laboratory at UCLA, where his research focuses on how information theory can be used across a multitude of fields, including learning, security, privacy, cyber-physical systems, wireless networks, bioinformatics and neuroscience. </p><p>    Professor Diggavi received the 2021 Facebook Statistics for Improving Insights, Models and Decisions award for his research on privacy in machine learning and analytics. Facebook announced the research program in April 2021 at The Web Conference. UCLA is the only University of California campus selected among the 10 winners and 15 finalists out of 134 total proposals from across the globe. Diggavi received a $50,000 award to support his research on a machine learning technique, known as federated learning, which trains an algorithm across distributed edge devices housing local data that could be sensitive and need to be kept private.</p><p>    Specifically, Diggavi’s winning research looks at privacy in personalized learning models. Most personalized technologies require multiple devices to analyze large amounts of data, which can jeopardize individuals’ privacy in the process. Diggavi hopes to find a way to ensure robust protection of sensitive data while also advancing individualized models. This award will help support a larger program in his lab focused on private, secure and efficient distributed learning.</p><p>    The Amazon Research Award professor Diggavi received helps fund outstanding, innovative research proposals across machine learning, robotics, operations research and more, while strengthening connections between Amazon research teams, academic researchers and their affiliated institutions. The grant program provides $80,000 in cash and $20,000 in Amazon Web Services promotional credits to academic researchers. He was not the only faculty at Samueli School of Engineering to receive this award. Yizhou Sun, associate professor of computer science, was recognized for her research on accelerating graph neural network training.</p><p>  Earlier this year, UCLA led all universities and academic institutions with eight professors selected to receive fellowships from the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation. Created in 1925 by Simon and Olga Guggenheim in memory of their son John Simon Guggenheim, the foundation has offered fellowships to exceptional individuals in pursuit of scholarship in any field of knowledge and creation in any art form, under the freest possible conditions.</p><p> Additionally, professor Diggavi received the 2019 Google Faculty Research Award.<a class="link" href="https://www.licos.ee.ucla.edu"><span>https://www.licos.ee.ucla.edu </span></a> </p>'

    articleAuthor: 'Professor Achuta Kadambi',
    textCopy: '<p  style="text-indent:0;"><span class="first-letter"> Achuta Kadambi </span>published a column in the journal <span>Science</span> about how medical devices can be fundamentally biased — not just in dataset representation as has been widely reported, but from a deeper root: the laws of physics. Kadambi described how the inherent physics behind medical devices could vary across race and gender. He cited several examples of potential physics-based bias. For example, recent research has shown that a pulse oximeter — a medical device typically placed on a fingertip that uses infrared and light beams to measure oxygen saturation of the blood and the pulse rate — is more likely to miss low levels in people with darker skin.</p><p>    What motivated Kadambi to write this piece stemmed from an incident at an airport when he noticed he had difficulties triggering light-sensing soap, faucet and towel dispensers, which he attributed to his darker complexion and the physics of light. While these factors might result in mere inconvenience when using a light-sensing faucet or towel dispenser, Kadambi said they might present life-threatening consequences in critical application domains such as medicine. To address these challenges, Kadambi offered a few suggestions on how to prevent these unintentional biases and improve equity in medical devices. For starters, he suggested that medical devices journals require authors to quantify sample fairness in experiments. At present, scientists are only required to provide statistics relating to the performance of a device without the human factor.</p><p>    Another critical point raised by Kadambi in this piece involves recalibrating how a medical device’s performance is measured. In such a scenario, the performance rating of existing medical devices may suffer when a quantifiable metric, such as race or ethnicity of a population, is included in evaluating the equipment. This is a concept similar to the Pareto efficiency in economics, whereby when enhancement made to benefit one metric (e.g. fairness) leads to diminution on another (e.g. device performance on the majority). If a life-saving medical device does not work well on minority populations, should it be redesigned at the expense of the majority? Kadambi noted that society historically has had great difficulties in solving such a conundrum.</p><p>  A recent National Science Foundation CAREER Award will fund Kadambi\'s research into the physics of light and how it interacts with variations in skin types and colors. The award includes a five-year, $500,000 grant to support Kadambi’s research toward developing light-based sensing technologies, such as facial recognition or medical imaging, that are more inclusive across a diverse spectrum of skin colors and types. Anatomical variations — darker to lighter shades, or smoother versus more wrinkled skin — often influence how someone’s image appears on sensing devices. Current efforts to make technologies more fair and inclusive have focused on using artificial intelligence to discern information. Instead, Kadambi will lead research that explores the physics of light and how it interacts with variations in appearances. Kadambi noted that the inspiration for pursing this topic derived from his own experiences with light-based sensor technologies, including one frustrating incident at an airport where he had to ask fellow travelers to help him activate light-controlled soap, water and towel dispensers that failed to trigger on his darker skin tone.</p><p>In 2018, Kadambi joined the UCLA faculty and has since taught courses on digital-imaging processing and computational imaging. He leads the Visual Machines Group, which develops computational-imaging systems to enhance sight for machines. Such technologies could apply to autonomous vehicles, search-and-rescue robots, as well as advanced imaging for medicine and health care. In addition to receiving a Google Faculty Award, Kadambi has been elected a senior member of the National Academy of Inventors, and was included in Forbes 2019 ’30 Under 30‘ list for science. He is also the co-founder and chief scientist for Akasha Imaging, a venture-backed startup that designs camera hardware and artificial intelligence to enhance computer vision.'

    textCopy: '<p  style="text-indent:0;"><span class="first-letter"> Clarice Aiello </span> has been appointed to a committee at the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine to coordinate a workshop on the use of quantum-enabled sensing, imaging and instrumentation technologies for biological applications. The workshop will convene experts in quantum-enabled technologies, as well as scientists who work on applying these technologies to biological systems. The goal is to bring together specialists from these diverse scientific fields to address challenges in biological sensing and imaging.</p><p> Aiello focuses on how quantum physics impacts biology at the nanoscale. Her research group, the Quantum Biology Tech (QuBiT) Lab, performs quantum measurements on living sensors, such as proteins and microorganisms, to understand how the sensors interact with their environment. Findings from this research area can lead to a broad range of discoveries, such as how animals navigate, advanced therapeutics for metabolic-related diseases and quantum information strategies for computing.</p><p> As a professor, Aiello has focused on bridging a gap in quantum mechanics education, which has historically excluded engineers. She also taught a Fiat Lux freshman seminar on quantum computing this quarter. Among the many honors Aiello has received include the Life Sciences Research Foundation Postdoctoral Fellowship from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, and MIT’s School of Engineering Graduate Student Award for Extraordinary Teaching and Mentoring. She joined the UCLA faculty in 2019, and is also a member of the Center for Quantum Science and Engineering. </p><p> Professor Aiello won the 2021 Postdoc Mentoring Award from the UCLA Postdoctoral Association. She was nominated by postdoctoral scholar Ana Valdés Curiel. "Professor Aiello greatly values networking and helping her group members, both postdocs and graduate students, create lasting and meaningful connections with others within the academic community. Professor Aiello encompasses everything a postdoc and graduate student would want in an advisor. Her ability to communicate and her openness to creative ideas makes it easy for her students to succeed in academia." In 2012, the Society of Postdoctoral Scholars began honoring exemplary faculty mentors in recognition of the importance of excellent mentorship for postdoctoral research success. Today, through the Postdoctoral Scholars Mentoring Award the Postdoctoral Association at UCLA continues that tradition. </p><p>Professor Aiello also received the UCLA Library Grant to Develop Affordable Course Materials.  She was awarded a one-time $5,000 grant from the UCLA Library’s Affordable Course Materials Initiative to develop materials for her  course on quantum mechanics for engineers. She is one of three professors to receive the award, which is made in conjunction with OpenUCLA, the UCLA Library’s Centennial Initiative. The awards program provides support to professors who create original, open educational resources that eliminate the need for students to purchase course textbooks.</p><p> “The library’s ACMI awards are meant to encourage faculty to create affordable course materials by compensating them for the time it takes to develop them,” said associate university librarian Alison Scott, who administers the program. “We have successfully collaborated with instructors to help them achieve their educational objectives, and we have eased the financial burden for thousands of UCLA students." </p>'
