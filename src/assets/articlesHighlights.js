    textCopy: '<p  style="text-indent:0;"><span class="first-letter"> Plumerias </span> are beautiful, colorful flowering plants that produce numerous flowers with fragrant scents. These flowers are famously recognized in Hawaiian leis and are easy to grow in our Southern California climate. It’s impossible to track all the different flowers and scents because there are countless varieties, however the pink, yellow and white varieties seem to be the easiest to grow. Reds and bi-colors sometimes need a little more care. Here are some simple tips you can use to keep your Plumeria plants healthy and blooming.</p><p> In coastal regions, Plumerias can be placed in the direct sun without harm. For inland areas, plants should be placed in a partially protection location. A little shade will protect foliage and stems from becoming scorched and will also prevent sun scalding on the stems.</p><p> Plumerias can survive with little moisture. You can even forget to water them and the plant will survive. Overwatering is the most common mistake gardeners make when it comes to Plumerias. They can hold an excess amount of moisture in their stems and branches, which make this remarkable plant very durable in gardens or containers in hot areas.</p><p> Plant Plumerias in a well-drained soil. Cactus mix is easy and effective as a soil medium. Plumerias planted in heavy soils are susceptible to root rot. This type of heavy soil should be amended with peat moss and perlite to add oxygenation and acidity.</p><p> During the cooler seasons Plumerias will start to defoliate. This is natural; keep them in a protected place away from freezing temperatures and keep watering to a minimum. Dry soil is okay; water once a month or even less during the cooler months.</p><p> Fertilizing is a simple process. Use an all-purpose organic fertilizer and apply it in late February before the plant awakens from dormancy and pushes new foliage.</p><p> In order for Plumeria flowers to bloom, their soil should be around a ph level of 5.5 to 6.0. You can use an acidic fertilizer called Nourish Bio Sol to acidify the soil and produce the best flowering results.  </p>'
