<p style="text-indent:0;"><span class="first-letter"> Mona </span> Jarrahi, Electrical and Computer Engineering Department professor, and Nezih Tolga Yardimci, a post-doctoral scholar in the department, have received an Innovation in Regulatory Science Award from the Burroughs Wellcome Fund. The award provides up to $500,000 over five years to aid in the developing of new methodologies in regulatory science. The program’s goal is to provide researchers with the funding necessary to develop new tools that will aid regulatory agencies like the Food and Drug Administration.</p>
<p> Professor Jarrahi’s research interests include terahertz imaging and spectroscopy, microwave photonics and ultrafast electro-optics. Her scientific achievements have been recognized by several awards including the Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers; Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel Award; Moore Inventor Fellowship; Kavli Fellowship; Popular Mechanics Breakthrough Award; Okawa Research Award; IEEE Early Career Award in Nanotechnology; Outstanding Young Engineer Award from the IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society; Booker Fellowship; Lot Shafai Mid-Career Distinguished Achievement Award; NSF Early Career Award; Young Investigator Awards from ONR, ARO, and DARPA. Jarrahi is a Fellow Member of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), a Fellow Member of the Optical Society of America (OSA), and a Fellow Member of the International Society of Optical Engineers (SPIE).</p>
<p> Tolga Yardimci received his doctorate in electrical engineering from UCLA in 2017. He was a member of the Terahertz Electronics Laboratory during his graduate studies, where Jarrahi is principal investigator. For his doctoral studies, he conducted research on large area plasmonic nanoantenna arrays for high-power terahertz generation and high-sensitivity terahertz detection, a technology that is now commercialized for high-performance terahertz imaging and spectroscopy systems. Yardimci is the recipient of the UCLA Innovation Fund, Henry Samueli Fellowship, SPIE Scholarship in Optics and Photonics and a Best Paper Award at the International Conference of International Society of Infrared, Millimeter and Terahertz Waves.  </p>
<p> The Burroughs Wellcome Fund serves and strengthens society by nurturing a diverse group of leaders in biomedical sciences to improve human health through education and powering discovery in frontiers of greatest need. Its financial support is channeled primarily through competitive peer-reviewed award programs. The Burroughs Wellcome Fund was founded in 1955 as the corporate foundation of the pharmaceutical firm Burroughs Wellcome Co. In 1993, it became fully independent from the company, which was acquired by Glaxo in 1995. BWF has no affiliation with any corporation.</p>

<p style="text-indent:0;"><span class="first-letter"> Professor</span> Paulo Tabuada has been elected as a fellow of IFAC, the International Federation of Automatic Control. The IFAC Fellow Award is given to persons who have made outstanding and extraordinary contributions in the field of interest of IFAC, in the role as an Engineer/Scientist, Technical Leader, or Educator. Founded in Paris in 1957, IFAC is the worldwide organization tasked with promoting the science and technology of automatic control in all systems, whether for example, engineering, physical, biological, social or economic, in both theory and application. IFAC is also concerned with the impact of control technology on society. For more than 60 years, IFAC has made various professional technical activities from theory and technology to applications and societal challenge related to automatic control. IFAC has provided diverse people with various services and opportunities to participate in the various technical events and to present and publish papers, etc. Professor Tabuada`s award was cited "for contributions to analysis and design of cyber-physical systems." </p>
<p> Paulo Tabuada was born in Lisbon, Portugal. He received the “Licenciatura” degree in aerospace engineering from the Instituto Superior Tecnico, Lisbon, in 1998 and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from the Institute for Systems and Robotics, in 2002. He was a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Pennsylvania, and then a Assistant Professor at the University of Notre Dame. He joined the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department in 2007, where he currently is the Vijay K. Dhir Professor of Engineering.</p>
<p> Professor Tabuada's contributions to cyber-physical systems have been recognized by multiple awards including the NSF CAREER award in 2005, the Donald P. Eckman award in 2009, the George S. Axelby award in 2011, the Antonio Ruberti Prize in 2015, the grade of fellow awarded by IEEE in 2017. He has been program chair and general chair for several conferences in the areas of control and of cyber-physical systems such as ADHS, NecSys, HSCC, and ICCPS. He currently serves as the chair of HSCC’s steering committee and served on the editorial board of the IEEE Embedded Systems Letters and the IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control.  </p>
